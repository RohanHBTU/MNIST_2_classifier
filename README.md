# MNIST_2_classifier
We have constructed a classifier using Logistic Regression and cross validation technique which classifies whether the digit is 2 or not. Precision, recall, F1 score and precision-recall curve have also been worked upon in the later sections of jupyter notebook.

Note: Please run the "Saving the MNIST dataset" notebook first and then go to other notebook. Please ensure you have the necessary libraries installed before running this project.
